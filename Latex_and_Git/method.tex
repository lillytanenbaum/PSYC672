\section{Method}
\subsection{Participants}
Participants (\textit{n}= 150) were recruited through local middle and high schools. Participants were majority white (White/Caucasian 35\%, African American 15\%, \textit{these are just placeholders and now that I know how to make the percentage sign show up I will fill this in when I actually have data}). 
\subsection{Materials and Procedure}
{Participants were asked about their time spent on social media, perceptions of their parents' social media use, and their emotion regulation skills.}
\subsubsection{Measure.}Will add a specific measurement here once I select it for my project.
